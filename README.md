# Statamic Vanilla Peak Tools

This is an addon for [Statamic Vanilla Peak](https://github.com/martingoldie/statamic-vanilla-peak) that contains tools like the picture partial, the noscript partial, the pagination partial, the toolbar and the missing alt text widget.

Maintaining Peak demands a lot of Rob's time and it probably saves you a lot. Sponsoring Rob makes it much easier for him to maintain this project and keep improving it. [Sponsor Peak](https://github.com/sponsors/studio1902).
